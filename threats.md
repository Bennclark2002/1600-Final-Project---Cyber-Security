  * Malware Attack
    * The most common cyber-attack out of them all that we most likely 
      see within our everyday lives. Those pesky multiple download 
      links that are on those sketchy webpages that you accidently 
      looked up looking for something else.... Yep! That would be 
      malware right there waiting for you to get tricked and download.
    
    * Once that malware enters your computer, it can monitor all of the 
      activities that you take part of and do as well as everything that 
      you enter. It can get all your confidential data and information and 
      can also be a gateway device to look into other devices on your 
      network as well!

                  and tricks them into downloading malware
          ** Whaling

                   such as a CEO of a company or CFO to get 
                   disclosed personal information and company 
                   information

                    money
                    
    * Advanced Persistent Threats (APT)
       * An Advanced Persistent Threat or (APT) for short is when a 
          sustained cyber-attack establishes an undetected presence in a 
          network and proceeds to steal sensitive data and information over a 
          period of time.
          
       * Some of the common indicators that there could be an APT 
          presence is the following.
