# Why i chose Cyber Security.

o Cyber security was always on my radar since I was looking at my career options 
before coming to college. It was one of the main reasons why I switched from 
mechanical engineering to IT. I grew up in somewhat of a military family, and 
Iâ€™ve always wanted to do my part of that. With my strong interest in technology 
and my still not knowing if I wanted to go into the military, I felt like this was the 
best route for me.
