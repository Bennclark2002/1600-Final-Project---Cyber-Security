# The Future of Cyber Security

* The future of technology as we know it now is one of the most important things, 
     we do not know its limitations, yet it's one of the brightest concepts that we 
     should be excited about! While the pandemic ruined a lot of business owners' 
     worlds and they had to close due to it, it has opened the door for a new generation 
     that is more focused on working with the cloud and serving technology to the 
     public over the past couple of years since the pandemic hit. After the world of it, 
     the rate at which employers and companies have transitioned into work-at-home 
     options has increased. Thus, resulting from that, the need for cyber security is at 
     its all-time high. The most significant future of cyber security is defending the 
     threats to the smaller businesses that are popping up after post-covid-19.
     
 * Not only would this benefit everyday people like us who use technology with 
     everything we do, but Cyber security will also be one of the most effective 
     defenses against wars in the future. Just this year, with what we have seen from 
     the war between Russia and Ukraine, Russia has been trying to cyber-attack all of 
     the allies that support Ukraine. That is a problem since if they were to breach any 
     of our systems and shut us out from it, they could not only get top secret 
     information that doesnâ€™t need to be in their hands that they could sell off but could 
     also get a hold of the plans that we have that could beat us with anything we try to 
     do.
